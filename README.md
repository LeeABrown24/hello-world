New Beginnings

This is my first attempt at coding within the Github. I first started learning about computing 25 years ago but I was young and impatient so didn't bother to complete the
BTEC ND college course I was doing and regret that to this day. After having a family and being an administrator for various companies over the last 20 years, I decided it
was time to get back to what I wanted to do in the first place - coding. The world has become a digital-centric world so this to me is a natural progression for my career
over the next 20-25 years to take me into retirement. Admin roles will eventually begin to disappear as technology replaces people to speed things up. I need to adapt before
my role becomes obsolete.
